# time-tracking-software

Another hypothetical project for training purposes:
A fake company wants a software (only backend) that enables the tracking and processing of working hours of their employees. The UML Diagrams show the expected functionality in a detailed way, so I will not elaborate further on the exact task here.

I did write this code in a group of three in order to learn about writing code in groups, so only roughly a third of the code is actually from me. The task was in German and my colleagues are German, so some comments and variable names might be in German as well.

Everything kind of works, but there are still some (now) obvious suboptimal solutions, which I will not improve as it would have only little learing effect.
I beliefe leaving the project as it is now - working, but still a lot of space for improvement - is best for my learning-path, so that I can move on now to the next topics and new projects.


The main purpose of this project was to:

  - improve my Spring-Boot and Java skills
  
  - improve my Git skills and learn to code in a group (working in agile environment, communication, pull-requests/merging, branches,...)
  
  - learn to write more RESTful APIs
  
  - improve knowledge and skills with relational Databases (Working with foreign keys, different relationships between data as well as general best practices)
  
  - deepen my Unittest skills and write my first Integrationtests
  
  - Building my first UML Diagrams
  
Update: 16.03.22: 

 - I applied some changes to Spring Security due to Validation errors, which occured during the frontend development.
 
 - I implemented Swagger for an OpenAPI based Documentation

 - I added some dummy Liquibase files in order to learn about DB Version Controle with Liquibase.
